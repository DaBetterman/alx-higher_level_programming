# 🇿🇦 0x02 - Using Import and creating modules 🌍

In this project, my goal is to utilize Python3 modules for diverse tasks. I'll engage in both employing existing modules and crafting new ones. This approach aims to enhance my understanding of symbol tables as they are transferred between files. Additionally, I'll familiarize myself with the usage of __name__ to dynamically determine whether a module is being imported or executed as a standalone script.
